# Movie-Review-Application
Spring Boot was used as the backend technology, MongoDB as the database, and React as the front-end framework to create this movie review application. We can post movie reviews using this application, and they will be saved in a database. With the help of this application, we were able to cover all CRUD operations, and the backend business logic was created using a microservices architecture. For backed, the films are a separate service, as are the reviews. The application is taking 1.2 seconds to load and post reviews, which makes the project more effective. 100% accuracy was attained when fetching data using API and posting reviews to the database.
